														<h2>Educational Issues outside of the US</h2>
														<p>The issues foreign countries face when dealing education</p>
													</header>

													<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>

													<p>Many countries outside of the countries have a number struggles regarding the
													education of the citizens, adults, and children.
													<br>These countries, such as Ghana, Which only 50% of their children get through the 5th grade, 
														and less than half of that make it through 10th grade.	There are many other problems that
														other countries like this have to face when trying to solve the issue of education.
													</p>

													<h3>Lack of funding</h3>
													<p>In many countries funding is a major issue, In school, and in many family. The school can not afford basic materials, l
														ike textbooks and desks for study at. Even when they do have these products they are outdated and worn out,
														and even then these boooks are in short supply,in Cameroon, there are about 12 student to every reading text book, and about 13 students 
														to every mathematics textbook.<br>
														The lack of funiding has also result in budget cuts, in Slovakia, the economic crisis has put a strain on the budgets of public schools.
														Education International has reported that the average pay of a member of the school staff is a mere 400 euros, which is below the OECD average
													</p>

													<h3>Lack of teachers</h3>
														
													<p>In these foreign countries, the school are often understaffed, and work in classes of over 30 children.
														Many teacher that teach in classrooms don't have proper training, or didnt' have a proper education themselve
														, this results in students not getting the education they need, and makes it harder to find jobs, in the already scarce market.
														<br>
														A report from Education International revealed that Latvia teacher's salaries are among the lowest in Europe,
														ampunting to a mere 6,ooo per annum.<br>
														The Latvia government failure to see the value in their educators, is detrimental to their citizens right to a proper 
														education.
													</p>
													<h3>Exclusion based on gender</h3>
													<p> In many countries, especially in the Middle East, many females are excluded from school and many other social events and spaces on 
														account of their gender. In these countries education is thought to be valued more by males than it is to a female.
														Females are often kept at home to do chores, and many girls too embarrassed to go to schoolbecause they do not have proper menstraul
														facilities at their school.<br>
														According the UNICEF, about 121 million children worldwide do not attend school, 9 million more girls than boys,
