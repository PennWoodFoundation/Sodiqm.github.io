														<h2>LACK OF EDUCATION IN THE US</h2>

													<p>When people think of poverty they automatically think of places such as Haiti and Etheopia. 
													We are so wrapped in staring at the sad staateof poverty and uneducation that is happening in 
													other countries we fail to acknowledge our own. America is struggle educationally too it's just 
													wheter or not we choose to stop it.</p>

													<h3>The problems so near we dont see them</h3>
													<p>In the U.S our main problem is not that we are ignorant to the struggle of our system, it 
													is more that we ignoreit. The thought that we are not as bad as other countries is what destroys 
													us. Our own goverment became somewhat careless with our education system. For example in South 
													Carolina tthe Kids lag more than the rest of the students in the U.S.The main reason this occars 
													is because the state fails to make quality public school a priorty</p>

													<p>There are a few solutions to just this problem alone. One major step that can be taken to fix
													the situation is for the states to sit down indivisually and decide what high-quality education is. 
													After they decide on what quality is they can then create programs to peice by peice solve the 
													problems. Once they start figureing out what is neededwe can set aside the money that is needed to 
													solve the problem. If the goverment gets more into the affairs of schools then the schholwill thrive.</p>
													
													<p>There is also a lack of diversity in school. District schools must learn to better recognize 
													different types of learning talent and look beyond the type of children then usually accepted 
													The natural push to make talented gifted programs better mirror the contemporary and ever-evolving 
													student body is a step in the right direction. The "talented and and gifted" label is one bestowed 
													upon the brightest and most advanced students.
														
													<p>Gifted students' learning gains result from complex,advanced,and meaningful content provided by 
													a knowledgeable teacher through high-quality curriculum and instruction af an appropriate pace with 
													scaffolding and feedback.These element exert influence that increases within structures that facilate
													student engagement in rigorous experience,including interactions with one another.
